## About B-Thrift

[cite_start]**B-Thrift** is a web-based thrift store application exclusively designed for students of the **International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)**, with a primary focus on **Mahallah Bilal** residents[cite: 26]. [cite_start]We believe that "One man's garbage is another man's treasure"[cite: 30]. [cite_start]This platform bridges the gap between students who have items they no longer need and those looking for quality goods at affordable prices[cite: 27, 29].

[cite_start]By limiting the platform to Mahallah Bilal, we ensure a safe, trusted, and Shariah-compliant marketplace within our university community[cite: 32, 33].

### Key Objectives
- [cite_start]**Secure Trading**: Provide a user-friendly platform for buying and selling second-hand items[cite: 36].
- [cite_start]**Sustainability**: Promote the reuse of items to reduce waste within IIUM[cite: 37].
- [cite_start]**Affordability**: Help students save money by offering low-cost alternatives to new products[cite: 38].
- [cite_start]**Technical Excellence**: Implement a robust MVC architecture using the Laravel framework[cite: 40].

## Features and Functionalities

The application takes the pain out of campus trading by providing:

- [cite_start]**User Authentication**: Secure login and registration restricted to the community[cite: 42, 43].
- [cite_start]**Item Management**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for item listings[cite: 48, 50].
- [cite_start]**Smart Browsing**: Search bar and category-based filtering to find items efficiently[cite: 53, 54].
- [cite_start]**Direct Communication**: Secure access to seller contact info to facilitate meet-ups[cite: 59, 60].
- [cite_start]**Admin Dashboard**: Role-based access control to moderate listings and manage users[cite: 61, 63].
